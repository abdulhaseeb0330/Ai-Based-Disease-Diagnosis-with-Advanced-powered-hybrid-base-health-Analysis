# AI-Based Disease Diagnosis System with Advanced Hybrid Health intelligence

🚀 AI-Based Disease Diagnosis System with Advanced Hybrid Health intelligence
 2nd Semester Project | Built using SQL & SSMS
I’m excited to share my 2nd semester project an AI-powered disease diagnosis system developed using SQL and SSMS. The goal is to fully digitalize a patient's complete medical history from birth to death replacing traditional paper records.
🧠💡 Key Features:
Every patient’s data (symptoms, diagnoses, medicines, dosage, etc.) is securely saved in a structured SQL database.
The system acts as a live medical dataset, where AI continuously learns and adapts.
Doctors input new symptoms, and the AI predicts possible diseases, recommends medicines, and suggests dosages.
AI considers patient-specific factors like age, weight, and medical history to personalize treatment plans.
It recommends:
The right dose and form (tablet/injection, etc.)
When and how to take/apply medication
The system merges physical and mental health analysis, enabling AI to become a smart assistant to doctors not just a tool.
⚙️ Tech Stack:
SQL for database
SSMS for data management
AI rule-based logic for diagnosis
📍 Objective: To create an AI-driven medical support system that helps doctors make more informed, data-backed decisions.
